git branch

add -d branchName to delete a branch

git checkout branchName
: To change the branches
add -b branchName to create and switch branches

there can be merge conflicts while doing this so be sure to solve them

git rebase origin main
: to rebase the commits of main branch to your branch

git log

git commit --ammend -m 'new message'
: to change the last commit message
